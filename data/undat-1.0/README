This simple program allows for packing a Wavefront .obj file, its MTL file, and
an accompanying texture file in the form of a PNG to be compressed and bundled
into one .dat file.

PREREQUISITES

FreeImage 3.1.05
Snappy 1.0.1

INSTALLATION

Just do an easy "make". The program does not install into the user's /usr
folder, since it's just a small helper program, for my game library/engine.

USAGE

To use the program, you need to specify its usage. To pack the 3 files into a
.dat file, call the program like this:
    ./undat --create foo.obj foo.mtl foo.png
    or
    ./undat -c foo.obj foo.mtl foo.png
Preferably, the files need to have the same names, sans suffix.

To unpack a file from a .dat file, call the program like this:
    ./undat --extract foo.dat
    or
    ./undat -x foo.dat
The resulting files will be named the same as the .dat file.
