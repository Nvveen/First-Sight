Dependencies:

libpng-1.4
snappy-1.0.1 (provided)
boost-1.46.0-4
sdl-1.3 (source provided)

For some dependencies, except for SDL, an older version number may work. I
haven't tested this yet. It's up to you.

Installation:
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make

Run:
    Go to the project root directory.
    ./firstsight
